# Data Structures And Algorithms Toolkit

## Description

This project represents a Java based implementation of common data structures and algorithms, with the aim
of solving programming problems faster. Think about it like a library/sdk to reuse the concepts and apply it to
programming problems, whether for the purpose of learning or implementing a practical solution. 


## How to run?

To run the application (on **MacOS/Linux**), one can simply execute the following from the root directory:
- Build
```shell
./gradlew build
```

- Run the CLI
```shell
./gradlew run --args="src/main/resources/prefixes.txt"
```

### Tests

To run tests, once can do:

```shell
./gradlew test
```
